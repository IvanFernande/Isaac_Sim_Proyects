# Isaac Sim - Development of Scripts in VSCode

## What is Isaac Sim?

**NVIDIA Isaac Sim** is an advanced simulation platform for robotics, part of the **NVIDIA Omniverse** ecosystem. It is designed for engineers and developers to:

- Simulate realistic environments for robotics testing.
- Safely test robotics and control algorithms without physical hardware.
- Implement and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) and reinforcement learning (RL) models.
- Seamlessly integrate with popular tools such as **ROS/ROS2** for real-world deployment.

Isaac Sim supports high-fidelity simulations that include accurate physics, realistic sensor data, and machine learning workflows. It allows developers to:

1. Test complex robotic behaviors like manipulation, locomotion, and perception.
2. Connect to real-world frameworks like **ROS2** for live simulation-to-hardware workflows.
3. Use **dynamic control APIs** for real-time articulation control.
4. Train AI models in simulated environments before deploying to physical robots, reducing the costs and risks associated with real-world testing.

Thanks to **NVIDIA Omniverse**, Isaac Sim integrates tools like USD (Universal Scene Description) for high-performance rendering and simulation, enabling realistic, scalable, and efficient robotic workflows.

## My Development Environment

Although Isaac Sim comes with built-in consoles for executing code, I prefer to work directly in **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** for a more flexible and efficient workflow. Here is how you can set up the environment to work with Isaac Sim in VSCode:

### Step 1: Install the Isaac Sim VSCode Extension
1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Go to the **Extensions** panel.
3. Search for and install the **Isaac Sim VS Code** extension.

### Step 2: Enable VS Code Integration in Isaac Sim
1. Open **Isaac Sim**.
2. Go to **Window** -> **Extensions**.
3. Search for **VS Code Integration** and enable it.

### Step 3: Start Working

Once both the VS Code extension and Isaac Sim integration are installed and enabled, you can:
- Write, debug, and execute scripts directly from VSCode.
- Seamlessly connect VSCode to your running Isaac Sim instance.

This setup provides a smoother workflow, making it easier to develop, test, and iterate on your robotic simulations and scripts.
